WELCOME TO MY LEARNING LUA GAME DEV PROJECT


I use this repository as a way to keep track of and view my progress in learning Lua. This project is based in the LOVE2D framework and written in VS CODE. 
This is my first time really attempting a programming/game dev challenge. I hope to use this to build my knowledge base in Lua and eventually branch out to developing in other languages on other frameworks and engines.
